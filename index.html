                I have been brought up in Gaya.I wanted to go to Kota for JEE preparation but due to financial issues,
                I joined MANAS which provided a competing environment needed  for preparation.
                DPPs , practice sheets , regular doubt clearance and technical alongwith emotional support of faculties 
                helped me land in a university with almost zero fees for bachelors. I was able to continue my engineering 
                easily and right now doing a govt job.<br />I really want to thank Manas Education Centre specially pushkar
                sir for making me such a successful person.

                Firstly, I would like to thanks to all teachers of MANAS Team for giving me this opportunity. 
                I would like to share that what motivated me throughout my journey in MANAS during JEE preparation. 
                I joined MANAS in 2016. And I can clearly remember that My name used to come in last rows of the result 
                list of Weekly Tests in 11th . But In Manas, there was a ritual to give Pen as a Reward to First 3 Toppers 
                of every Test  infront of the class. And that became the motivation for me that someday I would be 
                receiving that pen infront of the whole class and I started following Pushkar Sir and Dharmendra Sir. 
                I tried my best to be consistent and revise whatever they used to teach on daily basis. 
                Their lectures were very helpful in getting more focused and being disciplined. 
                I am very lucky that they were my teachers. With the help of their guidance, 
                I got the opportunity to win those pens every week in Tests in 12th and also Secured  AIR - 8090 ( General ) in JEE - Advanced 2018.Currently, I'm working In ADANI Groups. 
                Thanks MANAS and the Team.

                Hi, Myself Siya and currently pursuing B. Tech. (2019-23 batch) from NIT Patna in ECE. My journey with Manas was started in 2016.
                All the faculties were very cooperative,motivational and helpful.Especially the doubt clearing facilitiy , 
                DPPs and tests were very helpful. The faculties always focused to improve the students fundamentals and basics 
                which helped me a lot during my engineering too and to cover the tough topic in easier way.I was in all batch of 
                Manas since I was a dropper and they have designed the syllabus in a perfect way such that the revision of whole 
                syllabus will be completed till your exam. So, the main point  is to be consistent in revision and problem solving 
                and follow the mentors advice.Even Mentors helped me while counselling to choose a better branch and college according to my future
                 goals..Thank you Manas and their mentors(Dharmendra sir, Pushkar sir ) for achieving my goal from an average student to be an engineer and 
                 achieving the offer from campus placement too.I am very happy that Manas is again starting so that it can  help an average student to nurture their dreams.

                I joined Manas in 2014, studying at Manas was a great experience, 
                and played a significant role in my selection to NIT Raipur. Teachers at Manas did everything they could to help me 
                understand the basics, and they were patient enough to answer even my most silly questions. I believe I am capable of
                 doing any work I wish to do because of the values of dedication, hard work, and discipline that I have learned from 
                 teachers at Manas. I completed my MTech from IIT Kanpur this year and am currently working as a data 
                 analyst at LatentView Analytics. <br />
                Apart from academics and career, this institute gave me a very good friend circle that supports and 
                guides me in every aspect of life.

                Chandramani Kumar Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad For the small cities like Gaya, 
                MANAS came out as great help for us students at that time. It provided a great platform to us where we 
                nurtured our dreams of studying in top colleges of India. When I joined it and studied there, I got to 
                know how supportive and hardworking faculties are there. Especially Pushkar sir (Physics) and Dharmendra sir (Maths) 
                who were the heart of this coaching were tremendous. Also the DPP and weekly tests culture was very enriching in 
                terms of knowing our weak areas. There were doubt solving sessions and teachers who helped us in learning concepts 
                well. Moreover, these faculties are capable of teaching in any coaching but they chose us at that time so I am thankful ever to them for this.
